# FOSS-accessibility-hub

## What is this?
This is a Github repository I made to create a place where all accessibility issues in FOSS-applications can be collected.

## How to use this?
Use cases are:
### [An application] has accessibility issues:
In the 'issues' tab you can create a new issue where you tell what application it is that has issues and what they are.
Then a developer who wants to improve accessibility can try to solve the issue.
##### Want to submit an issue, but don't have a Github account?
You can also contact me via:
- Email: privacy_dragon@tutanota.com
- Mastodon: `@storydragon@dragonscave.space`
- Matrix: `@storydragon:semi.social`

### I want to improve accessibility:
You can go to the issues tab and look trough the issues to see if there is one you could probably solve.
If you want to work on an issue, react on it by saying that you want to work on it, so there are not thousands of people working on the same issue...
